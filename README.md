Key Features:
User Authentication:

Users can sign up and log in to the website. Their credentials are stored in localStorage.
Upon login, the user's details are saved, and they are redirected to the homepage.
Accounts Management Page:

The Accounts page displays the currently logged-in user's name and their profile picture.
It features a user-friendly interface where the logged-in user's name appears next to their logo.
When the user clicks on their name, a dropdown menu shows all accounts that have previously signed in on that device.
Users can switch between different accounts directly from this dropdown menu.
Logout Functionality:

A logout button allows users to easily log out from the current session.
Once logged out, the user is redirected to the sign-up page, and their session data is cleared from localStorage.
Responsive Design:

The interface is responsive and adjusts well to different screen sizes, ensuring a seamless experience on both desktop and mobile devices.
Smooth User Interaction:

The user interface includes smooth transitions and dropdowns for a better user experience.
The page is designed to be intuitive, with easy access to user account management and logout functionalities.
Centralized Content:

The layout is centered on the page, making it easy for users to focus on the primary tasks of managing accounts and logging out.
The design is clean, with a focus on simplicity and ease of use.
User Experience:
Intuitive Navigation: Users can easily navigate through their accounts, switch between them, and log out when needed.
Clear Visuals: The interface is visually appealing, with a minimalist design that highlights the user's profile and account options.
Responsive and Accessible: The design ensures that the interface is accessible across different devices, maintaining functionality and readability.
